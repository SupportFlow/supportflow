== Frequently Asked Questions ==
### How can I insert a SupportFlow contact form in my site.

Just add **[supportflow_submissionform]** shortcode to the post you want to add SupportFlow form to.

### Why aren't messages being sent or received? =
After successfully adding an e-mail account under SupportFlow > E-mail Accounts, make sure you wait for at least 5 minutes because the retrieval script only runs once every 5 minutes.

If it still isn't working, check the log for any error messages or clues. To view the logs, add this line to a
[functionality plugin](http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-create-a-functionality-plugin/), and then visit the SupportFlow > Log page.

`add_filter( 'supportflow_show_log', '__return_true' );`

**Warning:** The logs will contain private data, so be very careful if you share them with anyone. Make sure you redact anything that you don't want to share.
